# Probability Calculator

*This is the boilerplate for the Probability Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/probability-calculator*

Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls. What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.

- Since this is based on random draws, the probability will be slightly different each time the code is run.

## Testing
The unit tests for this project are in test_module.py. We imported the tests from test_module.py to main.py for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button.
